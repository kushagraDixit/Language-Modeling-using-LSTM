“It is to Chronology that History owes its use and beauty; as being without it a mere chaos, a jumble of facts confusedly heaped together, and consequently capable of affording neither pleasure nor instruction.”—LOCKE.

 PREFACE.
 Few words only are necessary to introduce this Third Edition to our readers, beyond expressing a hope that the contents will meet with general approbation, and that much pleasure will be derived from its perusal, now and for many years to come.
We would ask, as a SPECIAL FAVOUR, in order to ensure a wider circulation, that our friends will recapitulate the comments of the Press, by recommending this _History of Yarmouth_ as “worthy of a place in every library.”
It is seven years since the Second Edition, without supplement, was published.
No greater honour could have been conferred upon the Author than when the Heir Apparent to the Throne of England (His Royal Highness the PRINCE OF WALES, K.G.), on his visit to Yarmouth in 1882, expressed his pleasure, through Colonel Teesdale, in the acceptance as a present, of a copy of this History; and the placing of this work, with supplement (A.D. 46 to 1879) in the principal stone of the New Town Hall in 1880 by the then Mayor (C. C. Aldred, Esq.) was also gratifying.
EDWARD BIRKBECK, ESQ., M.P., writing to us from the House of Commons, on March 19th, 1884, says:—“I do not think my name is worthy of having a book dedicated to me, but I shall nevertheless be proud to have it placed where you suggest.”
The people of Yarmouth will endorse our sentiments when we say, for his zeal and untiring energy in promoting many special objects in the “good old town,” that he is worthy of greater eulogiums than we can bestow, and therefore tender our best thanks to that gentleman for his courtesy in allowing this volume to be dedicated to him—a privilege that was also given us in a first issue, by his predecessor in the Imperial Parliament, the lamented COLONEL DUFF. Neither must we forget to express our obligation to a select list of subscribers to the work.
GREAT YARMOUTH, APRIL, 1884.
* * * * *
TO EDWARD BIRKBECK, ESQ. M.P. FOR NORTH NORFOLK, THIS BOOK (WITH PERMISSION) IS MOST RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY HIS OBEDIENT AND HUMBLE SERVANT,
WM. FINCH-CRISP.

 Crisp’s History Of Great Yarmouth.
 A.D. 46.
 The Romans entered this part of Britain when the valleys of the Yare, Waveney, and Bure, as well as the sand-bank upon which Yarmouth stands, were covered by the ocean.

100.
 Burgh Castle, a Roman encampment, supposed to have been founded.

495.
 Cerdic, a Saxon Prince, and Qenrick his son, with five ships, entered the port of Yarmouth and named in Cerdic Shore.
This Cerdic Shore seems to have been a great sand-bank formed along the shore between two branches or channels of the Yare called Havens, by which two channels the river entered the sea, one running near Caister and the other near Gorleston.

633.
 Between this and the year 640, a Saxon Monastery was founded at Burgh, by Fursey, an Irish monk.

870.
 Lodbrog, the Dane, driven by a sudden tempest from Denmark across the sea, and, entering the Yare, landed at Reedham, where the Court of Edmund, King of East Anglia, was then kept.
Lodbrog is said to have been received into Court favour, but was soon afterwards murdered in a wood by the King’s huntsman (Bern) through jealousy.
This led to the imprisonment and execution of Edmund, and put an end to the Saxon dynasty in East Anglia, after Hinguar and Hubba, two Danish chieftains, at the head of 20,000 men, had ravished all East Anglia.

1008.
 First houses and habitations erected in Yarmouth on Fuller’s Hill, that being then the only dry land in Yarmouth.

He was made Lord High Chancellor to Henry I. of England in 1104, and died August 11th, 1119.

1119.
 St. Nicholas’ Church consecrated.

In 1622 they were repaired, and in 1674 rebuilt.

They went at a slow pace, and at the entrance of Regent Street were joined by the Mayor and other Borough Officers.
It was past 12 o’clock when the prisoner arrived at the place of execution; on his way thither he was perfectly composed, turning from one side to the other, viewing the populace.
After ascending the scaffold, he spent some time in prayer, and when the hangman had placed the rope round his neck, he was asked if he had anything farther to say.
He then confessed as follows: ‘That he was the murderer of his wife by strangling her with his hands, and not with a rope, as had been stated; he said they had lived a very uncomfortable life for many years past, owing to his wife giving her company to other men, which was the cause of his committing the murder.’
The instant before being turned off, he particularly requested to see his daughter, when he was informed it was not possible, as she was confined in Bedlam; he also desired the gaoler to look under the step of the cell, and he would there find four shillings and sixpence.
